# Functions

Functions describe responsibilities that engineers may be expected to fulfill for a period of time.

## Team Lead

**Staff Engineers** may be called upon to serve as Team Leads. The Team Lead does not have direct reports but should gain exposure to common activities performed by an Engineering Manager and is a likely step to becoming an Engineering Manager. A Staff Engineer does not need to be a Team Lead in order to progress on the Individual Contributor track.

### Responsibilities
- Directs a team to take a nebulous project, define it, split it up into tasks, and ultimately get it done quickly and efficiently.
- Tracks with technical complexities and deliverables for other teams.
- Works with product and design teams on sequencing of backlog stories.
- Rallies team members to push projects over the line.
- Partners with product owners to tease requirements and direct engineers toward successful outcomes.
- Takes responsibility for working across teams and driving solutions.
- Designs and refines processes that encourage a culture of collaboration.
- Encourages engineers to own investigations of issues and proposals to solve them.

## Team Architect
**Senior Staff Engineers** should be qualified to assume the responsibilities of the **Team Architect** function.  The architect function is dependent upon the needs of the team and the business, so not all Senior Staff Engineers are guaranteed to be architects and there may be circumstances where multiple Senior Staff Engineers are called to be architects at the same time.

### High Level Aspiration
As part of our efforts to mature in a number of areas throughout Gloo’s engineering teams we need to ensure that we develop a strong discipline in discussing, deciding on and documenting our architectural choices. This helps us in a number of ways:

- Ensures that we have touch points to choose approaches that can be similar across projects.
- Ensures that we can effectively train new teammates into projects and have confidence that they will understand around agreed upon approach based on clear documentation.
- Enables us to get feedback from other senior teammates and therefore improve our approaches.
- Ensures that when we open source areas of the codebase that we have a consistent approach to similar problems.
- Gives our teammates experience in researching, thinking deeply about and communicating our choices.
- Contributes to growth and professional development of teammates.

#### Strategy
The Architect role exists in our Engineering organization as part of our strategy. We believe:
- Good architecture is a skillset many engineers hone that can provide opportunities for them and their team to up their game.
- The best architecture is formed amongst peers and led within the team, not from outside teams or leadership.
- Architecture is intentional and creates a healthy tension between good engineering and fast delivery.
- Good architecture practices and processes are part of our future success and scalability.
- The success of the role of architect is best achieved by being a great listener, facilitator and decision maker. While this isn’t the addition of hierarchy, the architect will be responsible for stewarding the processes through collaboration that lead to decisions in an optimized fashion that the team can get behind.
- Being great at these architectural decisions will lead to the leveling up of the entire team. All boats rise with the incoming tide.

### Responsibilities
- Drive specific architectural discussions. Guide decision making, but involve the team in forming consensus and/or commitment.
- Proactively discuss architectural concerns with other stakeholders where decisions are likely to affect other engineering efforts or product specifications.
- Proactively track with industry trends and company strategic direction to ensure the architecture will support the evolving needs of the business.
- Keep close watch on emerging patterns or inconsistencies (conversations, PRs, etc...) that are likely to cause drift across projects or lead to future problems.
- Include backend architecture and best practices in architectural discussions.
- Participate in additional cross-team and product conversations, with other architects and senior engineers, to tease out and set expectations for architectural concerns across disciplines.
- Ensure documentation of architectural decisions for use among the team and other stakeholders (wiki, diagrams, flowcharts, etc…).
- Help other engineers (on the same team or otherwise) understand architecture hows and whys.
- Continue to contribute to code as part of the team with an emphasis on architectural focus and direction.
