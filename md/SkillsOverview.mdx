## Core Characteristics
Gloo is a highly collaborative environment, so your ability to show up as a great teammate is critical for us to establish a healthy and successful engineering team.

Below is a list of core characteristics that great teammates should demonstrate at every level, across a variety of skill sets (see Skills section below).  For example, Ownership is applicable to Delivery (owning the timely delivery of the projects you work on) and Technical Excellence (owning the quality of the systems you work in).

**Ownership:** You take responsibility for the success and ongoing improvement of things you own.

**Dependability:** Your teammates can rely on you to do what you say you are going to do.

**Growth:** You are committed to the growth of yourself and your teammates.
