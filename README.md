# Career Journeys
Web application for Gloo Engineering's career journey framework.

# Getting Started
```
# After cloning the repo, from the directory's root:
nvm use
npm i
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

# How to Contribute
As engineering at Gloo evolves, so too must this framework. We want to make it as easy as possible for anybody to request changes but still retain an approval process, auditing, history, etc. just like you would want in any code base. As such, we use git to manage changes in the framework.

There are a few ways to contribute:

## Code
For people who want to edit in their favorite local editor.
1. Clone the repo (just like you would any other repo).
2. Create a branch (e.g. `git checkout -b feature/reword-assoc-delivery`).
3. Push your branch and create a pull request in github.

## Github
For people who want to make simple changes straight in github's web app.
1. Open the file you want to change (most likely in the [data](./data) directory).
2. Click the **pencil** icon in the menu for the document to edit.
3. Complete your edits.
4. Add a commit message, select the **Create a new branch...** option

## Clubhouse
If you are not comfortable proposing changes via Pull Request, you can create a story in the [Career Journeys Clubhouse project](https://app.clubhouse.io/glooengineering/stories/space/844/career-journeys)
